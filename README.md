# ServerGuard

A simple minecraft anticheat plugin made by me (Chanakan Mungtin). This project is nowhere near finish and I'm also very new into anticheat. So if anyone would like to help then please continue reading below.

## Requirements

The server must be running 1.16.5 because currently the code was still bound to that version. In the future release I will try to make it have a backward compatibility with other version! And it also require you to have ProtocolLib installed on the server

## Contributing

This project use maven, to build with maven:
```
mvn clean install
```
Found an issue or bugs? please open an issue and explain the steps to reproduce the bug, and give the stacktrace (if any)

Want to contribute with changes? Please open a pull request and show what you have changes in the code.
## Features

Currently ServerGuard only have simple Fly checks, this is because I just started the project and so there are not many checks available yet. There will be a lot more in the future release!
